## Environment Variables

### Client (`client/.env.local`)

```env
# MongoDB (used by Better Auth for session/user storage)
MONGO_DB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/
AUTH_DB_NAME=StartupForge_auth

# MongoDB (used by issue-token route to check isBlocked)
MONGO_DB_NAME=StartupForge_db

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret_here
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_FOUNDER_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID=price_...

# Internal API key — shared with the Express server to protect payment endpoints
INTERNAL_API_KEY=a_long_random_secret_string

# Express server URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Server (`server/.env`)

```env
PORT=5000

# MongoDB
MONGO_DB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/
MONGO_DB_NAME=StartupForge_db

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# CORS — set to your deployed client URL in production
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Internal API key — must match the client's INTERNAL_API_KEY
INTERNAL_API_KEY=a_long_random_secret_string
```

> **Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` files to version control.**

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A MongoDB Atlas cluster (free tier is fine)
- A Stripe account (test mode)
- A Google Cloud project with OAuth credentials
- An ImgBB API key

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/startupforge.git
cd startupforge
```

### 2. Set up the server

```bash
cd server
npm install
# create .env and fill in the values from the table above
npm start          # or: node index.js
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Set up the client

```bash
cd client
npm install
# create .env.local and fill in the values from the table above
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Deployment

### Client — Vercel (recommended)

1. Push your `client/` folder to a GitHub repo (or the root of your repo).
2. Import the project in [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
3. Add all variables from the **Client env table** above in **Project → Settings → Environment Variables**.
4. Set `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL` to your Vercel production URL.
5. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to your deployed server URL.
6. Deploy. Vercel handles `next build` automatically.

> The `next.config.mjs` rewrites proxy `/api/startups/*`, `/api/opportunities/*`, etc. to the Express server. In production these rewrites target `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, so make sure that variable is set correctly.

### Server — Render / Railway / any Node host

1. Push your `server/` folder to a GitHub repo.
2. Create a new **Web Service** and point it at the repo.
3. Set build command: `npm install`, start command: `node index.js`.
4. Add all variables from the **Server env table** above.
5. Set `CLIENT_URL` to your Vercel production URL (no trailing slash).
6. Deploy.

### Google OAuth — add authorised redirect URIs

In Google Cloud Console → your OAuth client, add:

```
https://your-client-url.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google
```

### Stripe webhook (optional but recommended for production)

If you want real-time payment confirmations, add a Stripe webhook pointing to:

```
https://your-client-url.vercel.app/api/checkout_sessions
```

---

## Common Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All environment variables set on both client and server hosts
- [ ] `CLIENT_URL` on the server matches the exact Vercel URL (no trailing slash)
- [ ] Google OAuth redirect URI updated for the production domain
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas Network Access allows connections from `0.0.0.0/0` (or your host's IP range)
- [ ] Stripe price ID matches the live/test mode you are using
- [ ] `INTERNAL_API_KEY` is identical on both client and server

## API Overview

## Security Notes

- **JWT** is signed with `JWT_SECRET` and stored in an `httpOnly`, `SameSite=lax` cookie — inaccessible to JavaScript.
- **Blocked users** cannot log in (checked at JWT issuance) and are immediately signed out if they are already in a session when blocked.
- **Payment and plan-upgrade endpoints** are protected by `x-internal-key` so they cannot be called directly from a browser.
- **Role enforcement** is applied on every protected route via `verifyFounder`, `verifyCollaborator`, and `verifyAdmin` middlewares.
- **MongoDB credentials** and all secrets are stored in environment variables only — never hardcoded.
